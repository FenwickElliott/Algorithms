1. Linear search for 'G' in alphaebet would take 7 iterations.
2. Binary search for 'G' in alphaebet would either take 2 or 4 iterations depending on whether the median cell was rounded up or down when a sub array is of an even number.
3. fib(10) = 55, fib(11) = 89, fib(12) = 144

running a benchmark measure of:

    puts Benchmark.measure {
    for i in 0..40
        puts i
        fib(i)
        end
    }

returned:

linear: 0.000287 seconds
recusive: 40.745387 seconds


1. Binary searches do not function on unsorted data so unsorted data sets should be searched with linear searches
2. Binary searches are much more efficient (on averavge) than linear searches when called on sorted data so sorted data should be searched with binary searches.
The difference in performance between iterative and recusive binary searches was mirginal but the iterative performed better. The results were as follows:


puts Benchmark.measure {
    10000.times do 
        for i in 97..122
            puts search(alphabet,i.chr)
        end
    end
}

iterative: 1.177067 seconds
recusive: 1.389917 seconds
