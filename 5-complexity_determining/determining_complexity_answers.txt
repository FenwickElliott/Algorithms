1. O(1), 立(1)
2. O(n), 立(n)
3. O(n), n being the number of subcollections, the fact that they have been ordered into groups doesn't impact the fact that each one is processed once and only once.
4. O(2^n), 立(2^n) for each value of n all numbers between n and 1 must be evaluated
5. O(n), 立(n),
6. O(n^2), in all cases there are at least n runs, in the worst case all cells compared to the pivot fall to the same side of it and n-1 runs must be made n times
